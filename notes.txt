BIG LESSONS:
1. COLLATZ HAILSTONE SEQUENCE LENGTH PROBLEM IS HARD!!!
2. INTEGER THINGS MIGHT BE HARD? BECAUSE OF COMPRESSION AND SIZE AND DISCONTINUITY? (STILL GOOD TO INCLUDE AS HARD WORK AND A FINDING)


NEXT STEP: 
3. TRY CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS (with more dense sample values so that it isn't going to the moon) THIS MIGHT HELP A LOT. IF IT DOES, IT BASICALLY PROVES THE PROBLEM WITH (2).

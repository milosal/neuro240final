BIG LESSONS:
1. COLLATZ HAILSTONE SEQUENCE LENGTH PROBLEM IS HARD!!!
2. INTEGER THINGS MIGHT BE HARD? BECAUSE OF COMPRESSION AND SIZE AND DISCONTINUITY? (STILL GOOD TO INCLUDE AS HARD WORK AND A FINDING)


NEXT STEP: 
3. TRY CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS (with more dense sample values so that it isn't going to the moon) THIS MIGHT HELP A LOT. IF IT DOES, IT BASICALLY PROVES THE PROBLEM WITH (2). 


CONTINUOUS WORKS FOR SIN!

IDEA: IT ALL COMES FULL CIRCLE BECAUSE WE RETURN TO THE COLLATZ PROBLEM BY MAKING IT CONTINUOUS BUT NOT ACTUALLY CONTINUOUS (BY VALUE COMPRESSION AND ROUNDING). (I still think it's not really learning, but we could find out???)


GG!?
